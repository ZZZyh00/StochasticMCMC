Gaussian toy example with L1 prior

######################################################################


NOTE: Prior on the mean is the laplacian prior:


p(x) = \lambda / 2 exp(- \lambda ||x||_1)

This toy example is to estimate the mean of the data obtained from Gaussian 
multivariate distribution. The following steps were followed:

a) Generating data using 'generateData.m':
    First, we obtain observations using true pdf of a particular mean and 
    covariance. This true pdf mean choosen at random (for convenience, can also
    be pre-speficied). This mean is fixed throughout the experiment along with 
    the unit covariance and precision matrices.

b) HMC:
    We then run the HMC with a prior on the mean using 'hmc.m'. We define the
    MAP formulation that we wish to sample from in 'likelihood.m' along with its
    gradient in 'gradLikelihood.m' for HMC to iterate over the variables. 

c) We pick 'noSamples' number of run and consider the last entry to be the 
    desired sample for that particular run. This way, we obtain 'noSamples' 
    posterior sample of theta (our random paramater)

d) Using 'generatePlots.m' and known covariances, we obtain the posterior for
    mean which is also a Gaussian and compare it with the samples generated in 
    the previous state. We expect the samples to be clustered around the true
    mean of our variable of interest (mean of the data).

This is a single mode Gaussian model example for posterior sampling. We generate
the observed samples from a gaussian whose mean is randomly chosen from [0, 1]. 
The covariance is taken as I. 

Once these observations are generated, we would like to impose a bayesian prior 
for our parameter, mu (the mean). We take the same covariance for posterior i.e.
I. For this posterior sampling of mu, we run HMC. 

'generatePlots' shows the grouth truth posterior that can be calculated 
analytically (which is Gaussian again) and the samples generated by HMC.
